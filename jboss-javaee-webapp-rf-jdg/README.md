# Java EE 6 Web App and JBoss Data Grid as persistent database
## Disclaimer

This is a fork of the `jboss-javaee-webapp-rf` quickstart project available in the official [RichFaces JDF public Git Repository](https://github.com/richfaces/jdf-quickstarts).
The `jboss-javaee-webapp-rf` quickstart project is a simple webapp that demonstrates a Java EE 6 application using:
 * JSF 2.1 with Richfaces 4.5, 
 * CDI 1.0, 
 * EJB 3.1, 
 * JPA 2.0 and 
 * Bean Validation 1.0
 
For more details about its implementation please see the [original project source code repo](https://github.com/richfaces/jdf-quickstarts/tree/master/kitchensink-rf)

## Demo description
In this demo I'll show how to use the JBoss Data Grid as a persistent storage for the application Data instead of a traditional Relation Database.
